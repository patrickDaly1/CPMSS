        *** CREATING NEW CAR ***     
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
       ~~~ General Opperation ~~~ 
 - thinking thread that created new cars??
 1. every 1 - 100ms new car is created as thread which uses car struct and given random rego + random entry 
    - use rand() to generage number which is used as wait time. make generator wait this amount of time to create new car
 2. car is placed in queue and will wait to reach from on queue
    - determine how this queue will be made
 3. once at the front of the queue wait 2ms before triggering lpr reader
 4. if allowed in car will be given a number (parking spot) and will store this in struct. if not permitted will be given letter and car will vanish from sim
 5. trigger boom gate (10ms open and close) 
 6. car will then take 10ms to go park triggering lpr on the way 
   - determine how this functionality of triggering lpr is actually gonna work
7. generate random number between 100 - 10000ms and put thread to sleep
8. car will then take 10ms to exit
9. car will trigger exit lpr and wait for boom gates to open
   - check if car waits before triggering lpr on exit

          ~~~ Structures ~~~ 

car_struct {
        lp;
        entry_num;
        parking_num_
}

           *** TEMP SENSOR ***     
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
       ~~~ General Opperation ~~~ 
 - one temp sensor per level
 - shoudl these be threads that run functions to update values???
 - every 1 - 5ms temp will change to rand values
 - should be able to generate high value to test fire alarm

           *** BOOM GATE ***     
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
       ~~~ General Opperation ~~~ 
 - talk about how we want to do this
 - could just put car thread to sleep for open time (this does not acount for close time tho)
 - maybe have it be a thread that updates a bit to determine if boom is closed or open
